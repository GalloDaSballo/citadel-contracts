Compilation warnings/errors on flattened/StakedCitadel.sol:
Warning: Contract code size is 32381 bytes and exceeds 24576 bytes (a limit introduced in Spurious Dragon). This contract may not be deployable on mainnet. Consider enabling the optimizer (with a low "runs" value!), turning off revert strings, or using libraries.

-> Gas limit may be an issue but we can cut extra stuff
